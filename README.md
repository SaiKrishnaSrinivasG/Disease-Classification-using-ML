#Disease Classification using Machine Learning
Overview
This project leverages machine learning to classify diseases based on a comprehensive dataset comprising symptoms and diagnoses from 4962 patients. Using various classifiers, including the RandomForestClassifier, the goal is to assist healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses at early stages, thereby improving patient outcomes.

#Dataset
The dataset consists of records for 4962 patients, featuring 132 symptoms (as features) and diagnoses (as labels). Data preprocessing involved cleaning, feature engineering, and memory optimization to facilitate efficient model training.

#Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and the following libraries:

NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
Matplotlib
seaborn
#Methods
The project applies RandomForestClassifier, among others, due to its effectiveness in classification tasks. The dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing, including feature selection and data normalization, to prepare for model training and evaluation.

#Results
The RandomForestClassifier demonstrated superior performance, achieving high accuracy and recall scores. These results highlight the potential of machine learning in enhancing diagnostic processes in healthcare.

#Conclusion
Machine learning models, particularly RandomForestClassifier, can significantly improve the accuracy of disease classification. This project underscores the importance of advanced analytical techniques in healthcare diagnostics.
